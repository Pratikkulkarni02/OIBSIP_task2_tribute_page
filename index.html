            <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">Test Captaincy</h3>

                <ul class="py-4">
                    <p>For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time. Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut. In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score.

                        Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, he made his personal best Test score of  in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.</p>

                <ul class="py-4">
                    <p>Under Kohli, India won 16 away Tests - the most for India, ahead of Saurav Ganguly who had won 11. Kohli was the first Asian captain to win a series in Australia. Under Kohli, India won 3-0 in Sri Lanka in 2017, 2-1 in Australia in 2018-19, and beat West Indies away twice 2-0. Earlier this year they left England with a 2-1 lead in the series that was put on hold due to Covid-19 complications with one Test to go. In SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) countries, Kohli has won seven tests. The next best for an Indian captain in these countries is just three wins. In fact, among all Asian captains Kohli is on top. Wasim Akram and Javed Miandad led Pakistan to four Test wins in SENA countries.
